Build & Deploy a Solana Decentralized Voting DApp | Rust + Anchor + Web3.js + Next.js | Full-Stack Blockchain Project

In this solana Project, weâ€™ll build and deploy a Decentralized Voting DApp on the Solana blockchain using Rust, Anchor framework, Web3.js, and Next.js. Learn how to create a secure and transparent voting system where users can cast votes on-chain with full decentralization.

Weâ€™ll cover everything â€” from writing the smart contract in Rust, deploying it on Solana Devnet, integrating it with a modern Next.js frontend, and connecting with Phantom Wallet for user interaction.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used:

- Solana Blockchain
- Rust & Anchor Framework
- Web3.js
- Next.js
- Phantom Wallet

ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn:

- How to create on-chain voting logic using Rust & Anchor
- How to interact with Solana programs via Web3.js
- How to integrate wallet connection in Next.js
- How to deploy your own decentralized voting platform

ðŸ’¡ Perfect for developers exploring Solana DApps and Web3 development!
